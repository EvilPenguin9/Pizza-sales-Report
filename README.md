# Pizza-sales-Report

Welcome to my portfolio project. In this data cleaning, analysis and visualisation project, I clean the Pizza Sales Report dataset with SQL, then visualise it as an interactive 2-page dashboard with PowerBI and also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

**Project Guide**

The CSV data tables are the output of the SQL queries, where I clean the tables by sorting and exporting those columns for visualisation in PowerBI. 

Once the cleaned data tables have been exported as CSV, I import the CSV and the Excel worksheet into PowerBI.

I then further process the data in Power Query ("Transform data" on the Home tab), renaming columns, changing columns' data type etc. and bring the columns into a format suitable for visualisation.

Finally, I visualise the data as an interactive 2-page dashboard in PowerBI. I also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

**Future Project Aim**

In addition to SQL and R, I konw all litte Python. Once I improve my Python knowledge sufficiently, I aim to set up and automate where can can.
